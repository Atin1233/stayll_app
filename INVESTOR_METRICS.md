Here’s the same Investor Metrics Summary with your new pricing model and messaging baked in.

## Portfolio Sizes

## Target Customer Profile

* Primary ICP: Commercial real estate portfolios managing 500+ leases.
* Average Portfolio Size (Target):
  * Minimum: 500 leases (entry-level enterprise).
  * Typical: 1,000–2,500 leases (mid-market asset managers).
  * Large: 5,000–10,000+ leases (major REITs and institutional investors).

## Portfolio Value Context

* CRE portfolios collectively manage multi-trillion-dollar lease exposure market-wide, so a single portfolio represents material financial risk that justifies a serious, financial-grade tool.[resimpli**+1**](https://resimpli.com/blog/commercial-real-estate-statistics/)

## Pricing & Deal Sizes

## Pricing Tiers

Simple pricing that feels serious but accessible, with one platform and clear size bands:

* **Essential** (0–500 leases): $25K/year.
* **Professional** (500–1,500 leases): $60K/year.
* **Enterprise** (1,500–3,000 leases): $120K/year.
* **Enterprise Plus** (3,000+ leases): custom, starting at ~$180K/year.

These bands roughly imply ~$40–$80 per lease per year in the core ICP range, which is well above cost to serve but far below the value at risk from leakage or missed escalations.[ibisworld**+1**](https://www.ibisworld.com/global/industry/global-commercial-real-estate/1866/)

## What Every Band Includes

All tiers include the same Stayll platform:

* Lease ingestion + structured data extraction.
* Compliance calendar and key dates.
* Rent roll, escalation, and exposure views.
* Basic API or scheduled exports (CSV/ERP-ready).

What scales with higher tiers:

* Max active leases covered.
* Percentage of QA coverage and responsiveness of support.
* Integration depth (for example, Professional tier includes one standard integration such as Yardi/MRI/NetSuite/BI connector).

This keeps the narrative: "Same platform, more scale and support as you grow."

## Deal Size Summary

* Typical mid-market customer (1,000–2,000 leases): $60K–$120K/year.
* Larger enterprise portfolios (3,000+ leases): custom starting around $180K/year, scaling with lease volume, QA coverage, and deployment/integration requirements.

## Sales Motion & Conversion

## Sales Pipeline Targets

* Pilot-to-convert rate: 60% target.
* Sales cycle: 3–6 months from first engagement to multi-year contract.

Recommended conversion path:

1. Low-friction initial deployment on the relevant size band (no separate pilot SKU needed, but you can discount year one as a “design partner” if strategic).
2. Demonstrate ROI via:
   * Recovered escalations and avoided leakage.
   * Audit-ready, verified lease data replacing manual work.
3. Expand within account by:
   * Increasing QA coverage.
   * Adding more portfolios/entities.
   * Deepening integrations into ERP/BI and lender reporting workflows.

You can still offer a time-bound “design partner” discount on the first year, with a pre-agreed step-up to the full band pricing on renewal once value is proven.

## Cost to Serve Breakdown

## Processing Costs (Automated)

Per-contract:

* OCR/Text extraction: low cents per contract for modern cloud OCR.
* LLM processing: typically in the low dollar range per long document.
* Storage & compute: low cents per contract.

Total automated processing: on the order of ~$1–$3 per contract in early stages, declining with scale.[resimpli**+1**](https://resimpli.com/blog/commercial-real-estate-statistics/)

At scale (1,000+ contracts/month), infrastructure remains in the low thousands per month, keeping per-contract cost in the low single digits and highly scalable.[ibisworld**+1**](https://www.ibisworld.com/global/industry/global-commercial-real-estate/1866/)

## QA Costs (Human Verification)

Tiered QA approach:

* Core automation: all bands get automated validation and deterministic checks.
* Higher-touch for larger portfolios: human QA focused on top 10–20% of leases by value or risk, so you only spend human time where the financial impact is highest.

Benchmark comparison:

* Traditional manual review often runs in the hundreds of dollars per contract.
* Targeted QA for a subset of leases keeps your average QA cost per contract in the high single digits to low teens, delivering 90%+ cost reductions versus fully manual workflows while preserving high accuracy.[resimpli**+1**](https://resimpli.com/blog/commercial-real-estate-statistics/)

## Integration & Success Costs

Integration services:

* Standard connectors (Yardi, MRI, NetSuite, etc.) become increasingly expected for mid-market and enterprise bands.
* One standard integration included from the 500+ band, with:
  * One-time setup in the low thousands of dollars in internal cost.
  * Ongoing monitoring and support in the low hundreds of dollars per month per integration, amortized across the portfolio.

Customer success:

* Light-touch support and onboarding in the lower bands.
* More proactive reviews and “quarterly business review” style engagement in the higher bands, tied to on-paper ROI and leakage reduction.

---

## Total Cost to Serve & Margins

Using the ranges above:

* Self-serve / Core bands (lighter QA):
  * Total cost to serve per contract typically in the ~$1.50–$5 range.
* Heavier QA / Enterprise setups:
  * Total cost to serve per contract typically in the high single digits to mid-teens.

With revenue per lease in the ~$40–$80 range in your sweet spot bands, this supports contribution margins well above 70% even when including QA, integrations, and customer success.[ibisworld**+1**](https://www.ibisworld.com/global/industry/global-commercial-real-estate/1866/)

## Why Pricing Still Feels “Serious but Accessible”

* For 1,000–2,000 lease portfolios, $60K–$120K/year is:
  * Meaningful enough that CFOs and asset managers treat Stayll as infrastructure, not a toy.
  * Small enough to live comfortably inside “data cleanup / finance tooling” budgets without a board-level approval process.
* Against status quo manual review (hundreds of dollars per contract and weeks of delay), a $60K–$120K subscription is typically a rounding error if it prevents even a small fraction of missed escalations, misapplied rent steps, or blown renewal/termination options.[resimpli**+1**](https://resimpli.com/blog/commercial-real-estate-statistics/)

## Messaging for Investors and Buyers

Anchor on leakage, not features:

* “If you have 1,000+ leases, missing 1–2% of value is usually in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year; Stayll costs a fraction of that and gives you an auditable source of truth.”

Add an early-stage “founder guarantee”:

* “If we don’t show at least 3× value versus subscription cost in the first 12 months, we work with you on price or you can walk.”

This ties the simple size-band pricing directly to visible, financial outcomes and reinforces the “financial-grade” framing that differentiates Stayll in CRE.

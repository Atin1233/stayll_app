# Pricing Tier Naming Options

## Current Problem
All tiers are called "Stayll Core" which is confusing and doesn't differentiate them.

## Tier Structure
1. **0–500 leases** ($25K) - Small portfolios, automated QA, email support
2. **500–1,500 leases** ($60K) - Mid-market, human QA 20%, one integration, priority support  
3. **1,500–3,000 leases** ($120K) - Large portfolios, human QA 30%, multiple integrations, dedicated support
4. **3,000+ leases** (custom) - Enterprise, custom QA, unlimited integrations, dedicated account manager

# STAYLL AI - Investor Deck Outline
## 15-Slide Powerhouse Deck

**Target:** Close $2-3M seed at $10M post-money  
**Time:** 10-12 minutes presentation, 15-min Q&A  
**Tone:** Data-driven, blunt, no BS

---

## Slide 1: The Hook

**What if CFOs could trust AI-extracted contract data?**

**The Problem:** REITs lose 1-3% of lease value annually from missed escalations and compliance errors

**The Solution:** Financial-grade contract data layer with auditor-certified accuracy

**The Ask:** $2-3M seed to dominate CRE lease tracking before expanding

---

## Slide 2: The Problem is Expensive

**$3T+ in CRE lease exposure** → Zero data accuracy assurance

**Pain Points:**
- Missed renewals & escalations cost 1-3% of lease value
- Manual review: $150-300/contract, 2-4 weeks, inconsistent
- No single source of truth for finance teams

**Real Example:** Mid-size REIT (1,000 leases) = **$500K-$1.5M in financial leakage annually**

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity

**First-mover advantage in a $50B+ market**

**Target:** CRE portfolios managing 500+ leases with in-house finance teams  
**Budget:** $100K-$500K/year for data cleanup + compliance

**Why now:**
- LLMs finally accurate enough for financial data
- CFOs desperate for automated compliance
- No credible incumbents (CLMs are workflow, not data)

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

**Stayll = Financial-Grade Contract Data Infrastructure**

**Not "AI reading contracts"** → **Trustable financial datasets**

**Stack:**
1. Hybrid LLM + deterministic extraction
2. Multi-layer validation (rules + human QA)
3. Auditor-certified outputs (≥97% recall)
4. API-first for ERP/BI integration

---

## Slide 5: The Accuracy Model

**We treat accuracy as a financial SLA**

**Verification:**
- Model extraction (LLM + regex)
- Rule validation (deterministic checks)
- Human QA (top 20% of contracts)
- Third-party audit sampling (quarterly)

**Guarantee:** Halt scaling if accuracy <95% across 500-sample test set

**Why it works:** Proprietary 50K+ lease corpus + financial reconciliation layer

---

## Slide 6: The Product

**Commercial Lease Obligation Tracking**

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Extraction:** Rent, term, options, escalations, renewals (≥97% recall)
- **Financial Engine:** Rent rolls, projections, cash exposure (±1% accuracy)
- **Obligation Tracker:** Auto-generate calendar events (100% accuracy)
- **Audit Trail:** Immutable evidence for every field
- **API Export:** Push to ERP/BI tools (<2h integration)

**Out of scope (until $1M ARR):** Vendor agreements, CLM features, drafting

---

## Slide 7: The User Experience

**For Asset Managers & Portfolio Accountants**

**Workflow:**
1. Upload lease (PDF/email/API)
2. Auto-extract & verify (3 min)
3. Review financial outputs
4. Generate compliance calendar
5. Export to Yardi/NetSuite/B Trush”)

**Transparency:** Every field linked to source clause + audit evidence

---

## Slide 8: The Go-To-Market

**Audit-backed sales into established budget**

**Strategy:**
- Founder-led sales for first 10 logos (3-6 month pilots)
- Partner with CRE accounting firms & compliance auditors
- Marketing = verified data exports ("auditor-certified output")

**Sales cycle:** 3-6 months pilot → multi-year contract  
**Conversion target:** 60% pilot-to-convert (not fantasy 90%)

**ICP:** REITs/asset managers with 500+ leases, $100K-$500K compliance budget

---

## Slide 9: The Business Model

**Pricing:**

| Tier | Price | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Pilot** | $10K-$20K | Prove ROI, 100 leases |
| **Annual SaaS** | $50K-$250K | Per-contract billing |
| **Enterprise** | $250K-$800K | QA-backed SLA, on-prem |

**Guarantee:** Refund if ROI <3× pilot cost

**Economics:**
- Gross margin: 60% → 80% post-automation
- CAC payback: 6-9 months
- NRR: >130%
- LTV:CAC: ≥5:1

---

## Slide 10: The Traction (Projected)

**0-12 months execution:**

**Q1:** Secure 3 CRE pilot customers  
**Q2:** Build 50K+ proprietary lease dataset  
**Q3:** Obtain first auditor-certified accuracy report  
**Q4:** Reach $250K ARR

**12-24 months:**
- Expand to vendor agreements (after $1M ARR)
- Self-serve API onboarding
- Yardi, MRI, NetSuite integrations

---

## Slide 11: The Competition

**We're not competing with CLMs—we're the data layer they depend on**

| Feature | Stayll | Traditional CLM | Generic AI |
|---------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Focus** | Financial data | Workflow | Document mgmt |
| **Accuracy** | ≥97% audited | N/A | Unknown |
| **User** | Finance/ops | Legal | Everyone |
| **Validation** | Multi-layer | None | Best effort |
| **ROI** | Measured | Efficiency | Claims |

**Positioning:** Not a CLM—the contract data backbone

---

## Slide 12: The Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **LLM commoditization** | 50K+ labeled lease corpus + deterministic layer |
| **Slow enterprise sales** | Audit-backed ROI reports + accounting partnerships |
| **Data privacy barriers** | On-prem option + SOC2 certifications |
| **Overengineering** | Feature freeze per ARR milestone |

**The Bet:** Financial accuracy > feature sprawl

---

## Slide 13: The Team

**[Your Team Slide]**

**Domain expertise:** Commercial real estate, legal tech, financial systems  
**Technical chops:** LLM + deterministic hybrid, ML ops, enterprise SaaS

**Gaps we'll fill with funding:**
- Enterprise sales hire
- ML engineer (lease specialization)
- Customer success (audit relationships)

---

## Slide 14: The Ask

**Raise:** $2-3M seed round

**Use of funds:**
- 40% Product (50K+ lease dataset, validation engine)
- 30% Sales (3 enterprise pilots, accounting partnerships)
- 20% Team (enterprise sales, ML engineer, CS)
- 10% Operations (compliance, legal, insurance)

**Milestones:**
- $250K ARR by end of Year 1
- First auditor-certified accuracy report
- 3 referenceable CRE customers

---

## Slide 15: The Vision

**Become the financial-grade contract data layer for all CRE portfolios**

**When auditors, CFOs, and asset managers need contract truth → they use Stayll**

**Why invest now:**

✅ Single-vertical choke point (CRE leases) with measurable ROI  
✅ Wedge into $3T+ lease exposure  
✅ Quantified accuracy grounded in audit proof  
✅ Rational sequencing: dominate niche → expand laterally  
✅ Enterprise defensibility via trust + data ownership  

**Verdict:** This is a **real business** solving an expensive, measurable problem with verifiable data—not dreams.

## Key Talking Points

### The Pitch
"We're building the Bloomberg Terminal for CRE contract data. Not document management—trustable financial datasets that auditors can sign off on."

### The Differentiation
"We're not competing on features. We're competing on **financial accuracy** with auditor backing."

### The Validation
"Our accuracy model halts scaling if we fall below 95%—because we treat this as a financial SLA, not a marketing metric."

### The Return
"$2-3M seed → $250K ARR Year 1 → $5-10M ARR Year 3 → $50M+ exit → 10-20x return"

### The Ask
"This isn't a moonshot—it's a proven problem with a measurable solution. We need capital to execute against a clear plan with real metrics."

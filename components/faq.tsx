      question: "What types of leases does Stayll support?",
      answer: "We currently support residential and commercial leases in PDF or scanned format. Our AI can handle complex lease terms, amendments, and addendums across various property types."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the AI analysis?",
      answer: "Our models are trained on thousands of legal documents and reviewed by our team of property managers and legal experts. You can always request a human-polished summary for critical documents."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use Stayll with my PM software?",
      answer: "Yes â€” integrations with AppFolio, Buildium, and Yardi are in the works. We're also building API access for custom integrations with your existing systems."
    },
    {
      question: "Is tenant data required?",
      answer: "No, but uploading it unlocks predictive risk scoring. You can analyze leases independently or include tenant information for comprehensive risk assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my uploaded documents?",
      answer: "Your documents are processed securely and deleted after analysis. We never store or share your lease documents. All analysis is done in real-time with bank-level encryption."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does analysis take?",
      answer: "Most leases are analyzed in under 2 minutes. Complex commercial leases with multiple amendments may take up to 5 minutes. You'll receive real-time progress updates."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my analysis reports?",
      answer: "Yes, you can export reports in PDF, Word, or Excel formats. Reports include risk flags, key terms summary, and actionable recommendations for your team."
    },
    {
      question: "Who built this?",
      answer: "A team of property managers, lawyers, and AI engineers fed up with broken lease workflows. We've experienced the pain of missing critical lease terms and built Stayll to solve it."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I manage more than 500 leases?",
      answer: "Our Enterprise plan is designed for large portfolios. We offer custom pricing, dedicated support, and white-label options for property management companies and investment firms."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure?",
      answer: "Yes! We use bank-level encryption and never store sensitive information. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We're SOC 2 compliant and you can export or delete your data anytime."

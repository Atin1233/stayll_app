**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Complete ✅

## Summary

Updated the entire landing page with the new "Industry Killer" copy provided. All components now use the aggressive, competitive messaging that positions Stayll as the clear winner against offshore abstractors and generic AI tools.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hero Section (`components/hero-home.tsx`)
- **Headline:** "The End of Lease Guesswork"
- **Subheadline:** "Audit-Grade Financial Data from CRE Contracts in 30 Days"
- **Value prop:** "We extract rent, escalations, and obligations from 500 leases with ≥95% accuracy—clause-linked, reconciled, and ready for your CFO. No more spreadsheets. No more surprises."
- **CTA:** "Request a Pilot →"
- **Urgency:** "$25K for 500 leases. Accuracy guaranteed. 5 spots left in Q1."

### 2. How It Works (`components/workflows.tsx`)
- **Step 1:** "Upload Every Lease" - 500–2,000 PDFs, scanned or digital
- **Step 2:** "AI Extracts, We Verify" - Hybrid AI, human-verified, clause-linked, reconciles to ±$1
- **Step 3:** "Export to Yardi (or CSV)" - Push to Yardi/MRI, PDF audit package

### 3. The Problem (`components/features.tsx`)
- **Headline:** "You're Losing 1–3% of Your Portfolio Value to Contract Errors"
- **Problem statement:** Missed renewals, botched CPI math, unpaid escalations
- **Status quo is broken:** 4 pain points listed clearly

### 4. Why Stayll (`components/differentiation.tsx`)
- **Headline:** "We Don't Read Contracts. We Deliver Financial Truth."
- **Comparison table:** Stayll vs Offshore Abstractors vs Generic AI Tools
- **7 comparison points:** Accuracy, clause evidence, reconciliation, integrations, CFO-ready, speed, ROI guarantee
- **Closing statement:** "When auditors need lease truth—they use Stayll..."

### 5. Pricing (`components/pricing.tsx`)
- **Pilot:** $25K | 500 Leases | 30 Days (100% Human-Verified)
- **Portfolio:** $50K | 1,500 Leases | 60 Days (Quarterly Updates, API Q2)
- **Enterprise:** $100K+ | 5,000+ Leases | 90 Days (Native Yardi/MRI)
- **Note:** "This is a managed service, not SaaS. No subscriptions until you've seen the ROI."

### 6. FAQ (`components/faq.tsx`)
- **10 questions** updated to match new copy:
  - What lease types? (Commercial only)
  - How accurate? (≥95%, <2% error or free redo)
  - Yardi integration? (Native API Q2 2026)
  - Security? (AES-256, SOC 2 Type II in progress)
  - Processing time? (<3 min/lease, 30 days full delivery)
  - Export formats? (CSV, iCal, PDF, API)
  - Who is this for? (CFOs, asset managers, 500–5,000 leases)
  - CLM vs. Stayll? (CLMs are legal workflows, we're financial data)
  - Scanned leases? (Yes, Google Document AI, human QA)
  - ROI guarantee? (3× value or 50% refund)

### 7. Final CTA (`components/cta.tsx`)
- **Headline:** "Get 500 Leases Abstracted in 30 Days"
- **Pricing:** "$25K fixed price. Accuracy guaranteed. 5 pilot spots left in Q1 2026."

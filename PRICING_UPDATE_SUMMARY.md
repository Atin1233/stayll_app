## Key Messaging Updates

### Anchor on Leakage, Not Features

**Primary Message:**
> "If you have 1,000+ leases, missing 1–2% of value is usually in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Stayll costs a fraction of that and gives you an auditable source of truth."

### Pricing Positioning

**"Serious but Accessible":**
- For 1,000–2,000 lease portfolios, $60K–$120K/year is:
  - Large enough that finance takes it seriously
  - Small enough to fit into "data cleanup / software" budgets without a board meeting
  - Against manual review benchmarks ($150–$300/contract), even $60K–$120K looks like a rounding error if you prevent missed escalations

### Founder Guarantee

> "If we don't show at least 3× value versus subscription cost in the first 12 months, we work with you on price or you can walk."

## What Every Band Includes

All bands are the same "Stayll Core" product:
- Lease ingestion + structured data extraction
- Compliance calendar and key dates
- Rent roll, escalation, and exposure views
- Basic API or scheduled exports (CSV/ERP-ready)

**What scales with higher bands:**
- Max active leases covered
- Percentage of QA coverage and responsiveness of support
- Integration depth (for example, from 500+ leases, include one standard integration)
